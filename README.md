# SEGUID v2: Development and Discussions

This repository was used to developer SEGUID v2, which is an extension
of the original SEGUID method. Since then, implementations of SEGUID
v2 can now be found in repositories:

* https://github.com/seguid/seguid-python (Python implementation)
* https://github.com/seguid/seguid-r (R implementation)

The remain parts of this repository hosts the deprecated "SEGUID
v1.5", which was the first iteration of the SEGUID extension that
later became SEGUID v2.  Although some parts of v1.5 and v2 are the
same, there are enough difference that no one should use v1.5 anymore.
